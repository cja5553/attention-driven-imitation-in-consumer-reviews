`fast_text_and_cosine_similarity_main.ipynb` is for computing the cosine-similarity from the fastText embeddings for the recent and default display reviews
`fasttext-Control_reviews` is for computing the cosine-similarity from the fastText embeddings for the control reviews

Word embeddings include FastText word embeddings and cosine-similarity matrices

They are computed between each written review and the reviews that the gamer/reviewer would have witnessed whilst composing his/her own review.
