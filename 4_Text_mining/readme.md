Follows the sequential order

1. text_preprocessing
2. word_embeddings
3. data_organization

Text preprocessing involves pre-processing steps like emoji/emoticon conversion/profanity conversion/lemmatization

Word embedding involves FastText + cosine-similarity embeddings

Data Organization involves organizing the data so it can be reading for analysis.
