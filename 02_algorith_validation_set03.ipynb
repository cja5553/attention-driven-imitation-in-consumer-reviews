Although not as claustrophobic, still nightmarish.\\n\\n10/10 survival horror', 'Зашел в игру, открыл фабрику по производству кирпичей, закрыл игру. \\nСтавлю 10/10 разбросанных батареек по санной деревне', 'I went into this game with high hopes.\\n\\nI hate to say that I can\\'t seem to find enjoyment out of playing this game.\\nI understand that Outlast is one of the biggest names there is when it comes to horror, but in all honesty, I\\'ve always told myself that Outlast felt pretty overrated, I know it has revolutionized horror in some way, shape or form, but I feel like *as* a horror game, it isn\\'t as terrifying as it is. I mean that for the whole entire Outlast franchise. I feel it really relies on the same exact mechanic over and over and the story feels more edgy than terrifying.\\n\\nI\\'ve played Outlast one, and quite frankly, the base game was pretty mid, it was, okay, I can\\'t say I didn\\'t like it, but I can\\'t say I hated it either, it was mildly fun, what I said still holds true but I\\'m just glad to be able to actually get through the whole entire story without feeling like it\\'s not fun anymore.\\nGoing into Whistleblower, I tell you, it is one of THE best stories, and just, \"horror games\" I\\'ve ever played, that one was incredibly fun, albeit a little bit less terrifying, the psychological horror that it has daunted to me was amazing, I was a tad bit disappointed by the base game, but it was still fun enough for me to finish the story, Whistleblower was a ride, so I thought Outlast 2 would be even better.\\n\\nNo, it was not.\\nIt was, incredibly confusing, lots of things felt pointless, it felt more like I was just walking around aimlessly, at many point the game just felt really tedious, boring, bland, and just, outright annoying. It just had the same exact mechanics from the first game which was incredibly disappointing, it felt like nothing new, other than just way better graphics, a lovable one, on top of that, and one of the things that REALLY grinds my gears is how horrible the feel of the game was, it felt like my mouse was on roller skates despite how many times I\\'ve tinkered the settings, literally on any other game, even the first outlast, I didn\\'t get this, there were so many times that I\\'ve been blocked off or invisible barriers that just annoys me, I can\\'t get myself immersed, AI is incredibly outdated, my character would move on its own after holding down any movement key for a certain period of time, like as if *my* character itself had roller blades on, everything was just an absolute mess when it comes to the feel of the game, it was ANNOYING.\\n\\nBut the worst of all is that I, genuinely, CANNOT get myself to get terrified.\\nThe only parts this game even got interesting is when it went on about the whole entire [spoiler] Jessica Gray [/spoiler] thing, and its location, but that\\'s it, everything else about this game is literally boring. And I am infuriated by it, I genuinely can\\'t get scared by the game no matter what I do, this game, to me, literally just felt like a walking simulator and THAT\\'S IT, an even worse one because you\\'ll get confused, irritated, and nowhere to go.\\n\\nI am INCREDIBLY disappointed by this game, and it makes me sad to even think that this game could displease me THIS much. Outlast 2, I believe, will be one of the worst horror games I\\'ve played personally.\\nI was so keen to finish this game at least before reviewing, at least until the ending, but I swear to god I cannot bear it anymore from how excruciatingly dull this game is.', 'spooky', 'Not as good as the first one but I still enjoyed it, 9/10', 'gg\\n', 'OutLast 2 is basically the same as the first game but in a different location with fresh graphics. Not scary, running around with a camera up in your face and hiding from dumb AI under beds is boring.', 'i love getting molested by emo gay weeb french guy']\n"
