I've been getting by just fine playing alone with just the bots to help, but playing online is where it shines for extra enjoyment haha :D\", 'Nice game to playing with your friends', \"Really fun game putting you and several other players in control of a spaceship, this game completely depends on the people you're playing with, but In my experience it's not that difficult to find a good crew of randoms. The challenges this game gives can be somewhat difficult with some puzzles, but the spaceship combat is like no other! \\nI especially love the engineer role as balancing power is a really fun challenge that requires constant attnetion during fights as you need to maintain power to shields and weapons without overheating your reactor! With good communication you can achieve this by having cool down periods where you throttle the reactor. As a captain you need to focus your crew and take over any role if someone dies in a boarding action. Did I also mention you can board other ships and take them over? That's just one of many really fun small mechanics!\", \"Overwhelming amount of flaws compels me to not reccomend this game, but in the end it is fun and that's what matters.\\nPros:\\n1. Sufficiently nice combat system, both ground and space.\\n2. In some aspects space is more diverse and full than in most games, yet it doesn't feel unnatural.\\n3. Decent selection of walkable spaceships\\n4. When you fly ships you can easily tell the difference from upgrades and hull itself, you feel how a ship responds.n5. Good variety of addons and devices ensures that each new adventure is at least somewhat different from the last.\\n6. Diverse roles in coopt and cooperation actually matters (ex: pilot being too rought will cause problems to gunners, knowing when gunner doesn't need a missile lock can save extra power e t c)\\n7. Ground missions could use a bit more work, but are fairly decent.\\n8. Decent engagement range (at least in comparison to most other space games)\\nCons.\\n1. Single-player 'mode' is a bit neglected. While captain can do alsmost everything from the start with help from bots, efficiency is magnitude lower than with a live, nonbot crew. This is especially true for boarding.\\n2. Enevitably engineer runs away to man the turret, as a result reactor overheats - engineer's and scietist roles can be too boring in space. I suspect it could have been easily solved. In some cases 5 crew members feels overstaffed since some have nothing to do, but more often it's significantly understaffed\\n3. Ships are very static. While some of the equipment can get damaged, it doesn't look damaged and that damage is limited to 4 base subsytmes. Every box is always at the same location, adding 'hypedrive' equipment won't add visibly add to a science station beond an icon in UI.\\n4. Cargo and trade systems are outright neglected. Everything in ship's cargo is the same uniform size despite visually being different. Large turret takes as much space as a small turret. As a result there is a very simplified salvaging, no mining, trade or delivery.\\n5. Ships are as identical as they are different. Large ships use the same single reactor and shield that small ones use. Always same 4 base subsystems. There are some differences in cargo capacity, some ships have no extractor slots or have autoturrets, but that's the extent of the base differences. Always 5 crew. Don't expect to see properly specialized ships, nor a bot to replace you while you run of to repair or board something.\\n6. You do not drift, you move only when engines are on.\\n7. Some aspects of scientific and engineering roles feel way too artificial.\\n8. If you have two ships in the same sector under your control, you can't man both, despite captain being enough to man the second ship, while crew handles the first (would have been nice to be able to tow the second ship) and you can't even compare your current ship to your potential 'claim' properly.\\n9. No generated missions, everything appears to be premade.\\n10. Bugs. Mostly not gamebreaking. Some incompleteness. Assets are clearly missing (a lot of things share icons with 'scrap').\", \"I want to love this game,. Exploring and finding cool corners of the Galaxy is exciting,\\nThe co-op aspect is a great idea! Its really creative, and a Trekie dream game in concept!\\nBut the problems start to emerge rather fast in co-op\\nAll the side stations basically do one thing every 5-10 minutes unless a fight is actively happening.\\nSo while in co-op, we'd be exploring and trying to get to our mission, and at least half the crew would mentally check out due to there not being enough things to do, aside from maybe that one or two tasks every 10ish minutes, but only stumble across one hard fight along the way with the others being cake walks.\\n\\nEssentially, if you are the captain, you are the one playing the game with your friends supporting you. While everyone besides the helmsmen would need a second monitor to keep themselves entertained enough to keep playing the game.\\n\\nIf there were more active things for the crew to do while traveling, it would be more engaging in the long run. Otherwise you're more likely to get people to play Barotrauma with its steep learning curve, cause there are actual activities to do while in transit.\\n\\nI think this game would be an absolute recommend from me with the side systems having more depth, or a DLC(that id gladly pay for) to make the ship interior more interactive/interesting for those that have nothing to do when no combat is going on.\\n\\nIf anyone has recommendations on solutions for this issue, I'm all ears, cause I want to love this game!\", 'Great game, the only other game like it that I know of is bridge crew and this is far better, very fin and hasso many paths to take', \"It's only fun with friends and gets boring after an hour or two\", \"I am absolutely loving my time with this game.\\nI'm very much a Star Trek fan, and this game definitely delivers a fun crew experience.\\nThe bot system is good enough that it's enjoyable alone, but playing with friends is a particular blast.\\nWould definitely recommend.\"]\n","[\"One of the slickest nicest indie fps games I've played since DUSK, great art design combined with fun levels a simple but fun story and world, good game play and an grand ending that really feels earned. It is an recommendation from me. And the way I started the game a little unsure of the rhythm of combat and the progression to being able to beat some levels with just the sword was fantastic. I felt like a monster hunter by the end and would love to revisit this game and world in more games in the future\", 'Cowboys noire fajando demonios. Linda atmosfera, graficos y diseno llamativo', \"The style is gorgeous and works very well for the genre. Forget hand-holding in this one, from starting the game to figuring out the missions and then executing, enemies and tough with some bosses having insta-kill (boo devs - that's always a cheap move)\"]\n","['good', 'rel gud gam', 'yes if you like far cry 3 then you should buy it.', \"It's like far cry 4 but in another place and different villian is good\", 'very enjoyable', 'Every thing', 'Great Far Cry game, I love it.

Once you get into the game itself you can't use any buttons on the mouse. If you then go to the menu by pressing ESC your mouse buttons don't work either.\\nGreat game back in the day, but I can't play it properly then it is not worth gettting anymore.\", \"The shooting is decent, but it gets boring after an hour or two. Not much point playing this unless you're a hardcore fan of retro FPS games or mindless arena shooters.\\nThe janky physics (on bridges or tram cars) are more dangerous than the hordes of trash mobs. Painkiller needed more polishing. The game obnoxiously forces you to kill every single enemy in a level and the bosses are a slog--which says very little, since video game boss fights are always mind-numbing wastes of time. This means you can't speed through them even if you wanted to. Because the enemies respawn everywhere, you'll be running in circles looking for monsters stuck on geometry or sniping them with projectile weapons with bullet drop.\"]\n","['I this GOOD', 'Go', 'Simply the best, the best of the best 5 vs 5 competitive shooter out there.
